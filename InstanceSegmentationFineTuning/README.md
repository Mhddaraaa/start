# **Instance Segmentation**
Instance Segmentation is a computer vision task that involves identifying and separating individual objects within an image, including detecting the boundaries of each object and assigning a unique label to each object.
<br>
<br>
We can refer to Instance Segmentation as a combination of semantic segmentation and object detection 

## **Instance segmentation vs. Semantic Segmentation vs. Panoptic Segmentation**
- **Stuff** defines categories, which cannot be counted such as the sky and the road.
- **Things** are the actual objects in the imageâ€”they can be counted by assigning different instance IDs to each one of them.

1. **Semantic** Segmentation takes the input image and marks every pixel in the image to category class. Thus all instances of a particular category receive the same label.
2. **Instance** Segmentation, bounding boxes are generated for each instance of multiple categories present along with the object segmentation masks. It treats multiple objects of the same class as distinct instances.
3. **Panoptic** segmentation uses an algorithm to understand the difference between amorphous stuff and countable things like cars and persons. Panoptic segmentation uses the same backbone as that of `Mask-RCNN` used for Instance Segmentation with an extra panoptic head responsible for producing the final

## **How does Instance Segmentation work?**
- Instance Segmentation methods can be both R-CNN driven or FCN drive

- `Mask R-CNN` is the state-of-the-art model for Instance Segmentation with three outputs. It has a class label and a bounding box offset, which is similar to that of `Faster R-CNN`, and a third branch that outputs the object mask requiring extraction of a much finer spatial layout of an object.
